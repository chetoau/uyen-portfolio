                            <p className={styles.details}>In my free time, I‚Äôm always experimenting with new matcha latte recipes, and I‚Äôll never say no to a concert. I‚Äôm also an aspiring vlogger with an endless backlog of footage I haven‚Äôt edited yet‚Äîbut I definitely will soon! :D (this is a lie). </p>
