                            <p className={styles.details}>Hello! My name is Uyen (as in ‚Äúwin‚Äù-ning üí™üèªüèÜ). I am a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a major in Cognitive Science & minor in Data Science along with a certificate in Design Innovation.</p>
                            <p className={styles.details}>Coming from an underrepresented background and being a first-generation student, I‚Äôve navigated the complexities of growing up where, for much of my life, I felt like I was standing at the edge of a cliff. Discovering my passion for design has not only given me clarity but also the confidence to leap across to the other side. </p>
                            <p className={styles.details}>Design is invisible to the users, but behind the scenes, it taps into the complexity of the human mind. Being able to dig into a wide spectrum of individuals has allowed me to learn more about the diverse perspectives around me. By applying my interdisciplinary background and unique experience, I hope to bring thoughtfulness to my design process. </p>
                            <p className={styles.details}>In my free time, I love ‚Äústudying‚Äù and exploring different cafes. I am a borderline coffee addict but slowly transitioning to a matcha latte fanatic. I love playing with my doggo Luna and would advocate for her as the world‚Äôs cutest and fluffiest doggo! üê∂</p>
