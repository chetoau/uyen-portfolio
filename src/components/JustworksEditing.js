                  In the summer of 2024, I returned to Justworks for my second
                  product design internship on the Payments & Taxes Team,
                  specifically under the{" "}
                  <span className={styles.bold}>
                    State Unemployment Insurance (SUI) team.

                  Justworks helps businesses onboard employees, but we also
                  assist with the less pleasant task of{" "}
                  <span className={styles.bold}>off-boarding.</span> Previously,
                  the separation form lacked an editing feature, which hindered
                  the entire process. This project involved collaborating with
                  our customer-facing side as well as our internal team
                  responsible for filing our customersâ€™ unemployment claims, by
                  understanding the use cases and editing permissions of both
                  sides. This is an end-to-end project that involves
                  understanding the complexities of unemployment laws while
                  working within an ambiguous environment, identifying editing
                  needs to create designs that bridge both internal and external
                  teams.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  I collaborated with engineers who built the separation form to
                  understand how information is stored and transferred between
                  our customers and the claims-associate team. Along with my PM,
                  I identified the feature requirements and designed an editing
                  feature on both platforms, allowing information to seamlessly
                  flow between them. This feature will be shipped by the end of
                  the year.
